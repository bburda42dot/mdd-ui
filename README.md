# MDD-UI - Diagnostic Database Viewer

A terminal-based user interface for browsing and exploring MDD (Marvelous Diagnostic Data) diagnostic databases. Built with Rust and [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/), this tool provides an efficient way to navigate ECU diagnostic services, parameters, and metadata.

**DISCLAIMER** 
This tool is 99% vibe coded, and this is pretty visible in the codebase, anyhow it works, which is good enough for now.
This project is in early development and may contain bugs or incomplete features. 
Use at your own risk. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve the tool.

## Structure

The UI is organized into three main areas with hierarchical navigation:

### Tree View Hierarchy
The tree view provides a complete hierarchical representation of the MDD database:

#### **Top-Level Sections**
- **Variants**: ECU variants (base and specific configurations)
  - Each variant contains:
    - Summary tab with variant metadata
    - Parent Refs (if present) with not-inherited element tabs
    - Functional Classes (with cross-variant service aggregation)
    - Diag-Comms (diagnostic services and single ECU jobs)
    - Requests (services with request parameters)
    - Pos-Responses (services with positive responses)
    - Neg-Responses (services with negative responses)
    - State Charts (state machines and transitions)
    - ComParam Refs (communication parameters)

- **Functional Groups**: Diagnostic functional groupings
  - Each group contains similar structure to variants

- **ECU Shared Data**: Shared diagnostic data across functional groups
  - Deduplicated references to shared layers

- **Protocols**: Communication protocol definitions
  - Protocol-level diagnostic layers

#### **Service Display**
- **DiagComms**: Main diagnostic services section
  - Services sorted by ID (default) or name (toggle with `s`)
  - Shows: Service ID (0xXX), Sub-function ID (if present), Service name
  - Inherited services shown with source layer name and gray styling
  - Single ECU Jobs listed after services

- **Requests/Responses Sections**: Filtered views
  - Same services as DiagComms but filtered by capability
  - Maintains ID-based or name-based sorting

### Detail Panes
When a node is selected, the detail pane displays comprehensive information in a tabbed interface:

#### **Service Detail Tabs**
1. **Overview**: Service-level information
   - Service ID and sub-function ID
   - Semantic description
   - Diagnostic layer reference

2. **Request**: Request parameters (if present)
   - Parameter name, byte position, bit position
   - Semantic description
   - Coded values (hex formatted)
   - DOP references (clickable for details)

3. **Positive Response(s)**: One or more tabs for positive responses
   - Multiple response definitions displayed as separate tabs
   - Same parameter detail format as Request

4. **Negative Response(s)**: NRC definitions
   - Negative Response Code parameters
   - Error condition definitions

5. **ComParam-Refs**: Communication parameter references
   - Parameter values and complex values
   - Protocol and protocol stack information

6. **Audience**: Service audience flags
   - Manufacturing, Development, Aftersales, Aftermarket indicators

#### **Variant Detail Tabs**
1. **Summary**: Basic variant information
   - Variant name, base variant status
   - Short name and long name

2. **Parent Refs** (if present): Parent reference information
   - Reference type (Variant, ECU Shared Data, Protocol, Functional Group)
   - Reference short name

#### **Parent Refs Detail Tabs**
1. **Parent Refs List**: Basic reference information
2. **Not Inherited DiagComms**: Services not inherited from parent (clickable references)
3. **Not Inherited DiagVariables**: Variables excluded from inheritance
4. **Not Inherited Dops**: Data Object Properties not inherited
5. **Not Inherited Tables**: Tables excluded from inheritance

#### **State Chart Detail**

- **States**: List of all states in the chart

#### **Functional Class Detail**
- **Class Definition**: Functional class metadata
- **Services/Jobs**: All services and jobs belonging to this class (aggregated across variants)

### Navigation Features
- **Independent Tab Navigation**: Each tab maintains its own scroll position and cursor
- **Row Selection**: Navigate within tables using j/k keys
- **Column Focus**: Switch focused column with `,` and `.` for resizing
